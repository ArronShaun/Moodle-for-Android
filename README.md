An opensource Android implementation of Moodle API's
# added by Shaun
Moodle-forAndroid project is forked from M0nk3yofdoom/Moodle-for-Android
This project is originally in English, so we will translate it into CHINESE including all UI Elements.
Transalation is not the only thing we do, but make a compiler to compile code to generate
a varied application base on what site you have got.
Like this:
Run Desktop App MoodleAppGenerator
Fill in the form with your website information
Submit information and you'll get a customed APP of your own. It's free.
